== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there additional requirements to this Plugin? =

With this plugin you can take full advantage of Animate.css anywhere on your site. The Animation Controls are available everywhere, where the Gutenberg Block Editor is used (e.g. any page or post).

= Which particular blocks will this work with? =

Animations Controls are instantly available on **any block** upon plugin activation, including third-party and custom blocks! _Check out details on how to limit animation controls to certain blocks in the [source code](https://github.com/dkress59/wp-gutenberg-animate) on GitHub._
